## Person
### Background
>Hjuldyr was born to a minor noble duergar family in Gracklstugh, one of the few remaining duergar cities.  His family was known most for their arcane knowledge and power, and due to this Hjuldyr was placed in a magical academy at an early age and took a particular interest in the study of duergar history, or, as his studies led him, the history of dwarven civilization and migration in general.  This interest ultimately overtook any commitment Hjuldyr had to arcane practices.  After several years of studying it became apparent that the duergar were degenerating as a result of the Underdark's influence.  Between being enslaved by mindflayers and worshipping evil deities, the duergar civilization more mirrored the abject cruelty of drow civilization than the grand and pious dwarven civilizations that preceeded.

>This desire to re-integrate with overworld dwarves ultimately led Hjuldyr to embark upon a pilgrimage to the overworld, specifically to seek out the shield dwarves and join their society.  Alas, Hjuldyr's choice was poor, and the shield dwarves (already a highly protective civilization) rejected even his entry to Ammarindar, citing duergar hostility towards their caravans in the Underdark.  Dejected and alone on the surface, Hjuldyr sought out any dwarf that would accept him, culminating in a chance meeting of a gold dwarf who belonged to a society of clerics that served in civilizations all across Faerun.  This society, The Brethren of the Divine Hammer, took in Hjuldyr with little resistance and trained him in their ways.

>After several years with The Brethren the time would come for Hjuldyr's mission, the final requirement for full membership.  For most members this mission would be a standard bureaucratic operation: some kingdom has an open position in a temple or in a guard unit and the cleric would serve in that position for a year before returning to The Brethren and undergoing the final initiation rites.  For Hjuldyr, however, the elders of The Brethren decided he should return to the Underdark.  They agreed with Hjuldyr, the duergar were degenerating in the Underdark and their society could not sustain such a cruel and malevolent culture, and the most holy mission he could undertake for all deities of healing and light would be to return to Gracklstugh and spread the idea of returning to the overworld and re-integrating with dwarven societies.

>Hjuldyr embarked on his mission and returned to the Underdark, but Gracklstugh rejected him as the shield dwarves did before them.  His word was branded heresy and he was expelled from the city with the threat of death should he return.  Angry but not deterred, Hjuldyr began traveling the Underdark in search of smaller duergar outposts where his word might find some footing, or at least where he wouldn't be so easily dispatched by noble militias.  This method proved to be somewhat effective, though rejection was still extremely commonplace, but the Underdark is a dangerous place and one can only be lucky for so long...

### Personality
>On the surface Hjuldyr has the traditional dwarven temperament, as jolly as a creature can be in the presence of drink and good food, and as serious as a creature can be when it comes to tasks set forth.  When pressed, however, one will find that Hjuldyr is still somewhat subject to the cultural conditioning of duergar society, and threats, even joking, will reveal how short and fiery his temper is.

## Spells

### Wizard (1 Level)
* **Cantrips**
  * Mending
  ```
    **Casting Time**: 1 minute
    **Range**: Touch
    **Components**: V S M (Two lodestones)
    **Duration**: Instantaneous
    **Classes**: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
    *This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.
    This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.*
    ```
  * Prestidigitation
  ```
    **Casting Time**: 1 action
    **Range**: 10 feet
    **Components**: V S
    **Duration**: Up to 1 hour
    **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
    *This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
    You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
    You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
    You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
    You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
    You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
    You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.
    If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.*
    ```
  * Lightning Lure
  ```
    **Casting Time**: 1 action
    **Range**: Self (15-foot radius)
    **Components**: V
    **Duration**: Instantaneous
    *You create a lash of lightning energy that strikes at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you and then take 1d8 lightning damage if it is within 5 feet of you.*
    ```
* **1st Level**
  * Diguise Self
  ```
    **Casting Time**: 1 action
    **Range**: Self
    **Components**: V S
    **Duration**: 1 hour
    **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
    *You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
    The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
    To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.*
    ```
  * Mage Armor
  ```
    **Casting Time**: 1 action
    **Range**: Touch
    **Components**: V S M (A piece of cured leather)
    **Duration**: 8 hours
    **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard
    *You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.*
    ```

### Cleric (2 Levels)
* **Channel Divinity**
  * Turn Undead
  ```
    *As an action, you present your holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring The Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take Reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to Escape from an Effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.*
    ```
  * Preserve Life
  ```
    *As an action, you present your holy Symbol and evoke Healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level.
    Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an Undead or a Construct.*
    ```
* **Cantrips**
  * Resistance
  ```
    **Casting Time**: 1 action
    **Range**: Touch
    **Components**: V S M (A miniature cloak)
    **Duration**: Up to 1 minute
    **Classes**: Cleric, Druid
    *You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.*
    ```
  * Light
  ```
    **Casting Time**: 1 action
    **Range**: Touch
    **Components**: V M (A firefly or phosphorescent moss)
    **Duration**: 1 hour
    **Classes**: Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard
    *You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.
    If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.*
    ```
  * Spare the Dying
  ```
    **Casting Time**: 1 action
    **Range**: Touch
    **Components**: V S
    **Duration**: Instantaneous
    **Classes**: Cleric
    *You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.*
    ```
* **1st Level**
  * Shield of Faith
  ```
    **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
    **Range**: 60 feet
    **Components**: V S M (A small parchment with a bit of holy text written on it)
    **Duration**: Up to 10 minutes
    **Classes**: Cleric, Paladin
    *A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.*

    **Components**: V S
    **Duration**: Instantaneous
    **Classes**: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger
    *A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
    At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the Healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.*
    ```
  * Healing Word
  ```
    **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
    **Range**: 60 feet
    **Components**: V
    **Duration**: Instantaneous
    **Classes**: Bard, Cleric, Druid
    *A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
    At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the Healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.*
