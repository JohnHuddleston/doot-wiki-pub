# Session Log for 6 June 2021

## Pre-session Notes
* Hjuldyr was captured by a band of slavers in the Underdark and held in a cage in their camp.  The slavers abruptly left one morning, Hjuldyr picked up mentions of the Phobos festival and, in much more concerned tones, carrion crawlers.  After the slavers had departed, Hjuldyr took the opportunity and used prestidigitation to create a skeleton key that would open his cage.  Having never seen a drow slaver band in the area before, Hjuldyr began ransacking their letters and loot in search of any information he could find.  Unfortunately a few of the slavers decided to return, having had the idea to use Hjuldyr as a sort of sacrificial bait to keep the carrion crawlers off their tail, and they happened upon Hjuldyr, surrounded by their belongings.  After beating Hjuldyr into unconsciousness and gathering up what they could carry, the slavers left again to catch up with the rest of their band.  Enter party.
